ISSUES: Cannot set groundspeed in AUTO mode. Current script goes 5 m/s
Maybe this thread will get a helpful comment? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38470005/dronekit-changing-groundspeed-in-auto-mode-implementing-mav-cmd-do-change-spe
UNFINISHED

This program uses 3DR's DroneKit and keypoller (from a stackoverflow response) to fly multiple paths, depending on user input.

COMMANDS:
"p" (only during a mission): plays or pauses the program
"a", "b", "c", ... (between missions): picks a route.
