I'm doing research and we're working with a 3DR drone. I'm wondering about how dronekit interacts with the controller‚Äînamely, when the drone is running on a path loaded from a python program (in either in auto or guided mode)‚Äîdoes using the controller pull the drone away from that path?

Hello Amy,

Thank you for contacting 3DR Tech Support.

Let me work in the answer, can you give me a moment?

I'm in contact with engineering, one moment, please

Hello Amy. Are you asking that if the controller get inhibited while in Auto or Guided?
Amy Chen
I think so yes


Aram
No. The phyton script will change the flight mode of the vehicle into Auto or Guided, but the link with the controller will still active, and you will still be able to use Pause or FLY to change the flight mode back to FLY (Loiter)
Amy Chen
Ok thanks so much :) Also we're not super clear on the difference between auto and guided mode---could you help clarify this for us?


Aram
We would need to back up a little to ArduCopter in general

Let me give you some links

http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flight-modes.html?highlight=flight%20modes

So.. in other words. 

on Auto you program a pre planned set of waypoints and actions and the vehicle will execute that "mission" while in Auto. 

Guided requires the constant update for the action that you require the vehicle to do

Auto: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/auto-mode.html#auto-mode

Got it, thank you. In guided mode, would we be able to interrupt the current goto command with some sort of pause/play command through the command line?


Aram
correct
Amy Chen
ok, great :) Thanks for being so helpful!


Aram
no problem :) 

Is there anything else we can help?
Amy Chen
Mmmm not that I know of. Thanks again and have a good day!
